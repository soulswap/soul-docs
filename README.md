# Introduction

## What is Soul?

Soul is a community-driven organization built to solve what might be called the “liquidity problem.” One may define this problem as the inability of disparate forms of liquidity to connect with markets in a decentralized way, and vice versa. While other solutions provide incrementally progressive advances toward solving the problem of liquidity, Soul’s progress is intended to create a broader range of network effects. Rather than limiting itself to a single solution on a single blockchain, Soul intertwines many decentralized markets, instruments, and networks. 

Thus far, the **core products**, which will be described in more detail here, include a decentralized AMM exchange, liquidity mining rewards, and a lottery. Soul’s products are configured in a way that allows the entire platform to maintain decentralized governance of SOUL token holders, while continuing to innovate on the collective foundations by design. Whereas major structural changes are voted on by the community, the day-to-day operations, rebalancing of pools and ratios, business strategy, and overall development is ultimately decided on by cofounders Enchantress Buns and DeGatchi and the core team.

Future initiatives include incorporating limit orders, a decentralized lending market, yield instruments, staking derivatives, an NFT market, decentralized launchpad, and much more.

The following documentation details the functional and technical aspects of the ecosystem products, as well as customized video tutorials attached.
